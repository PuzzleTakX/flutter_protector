This plugin offers various methods to enhance the security of your Flutter applications by providing information about the device and platform. It includes checks for emulator detection, root/jailbreak status, sniffing apps, VPN connection status, proxy settings, and more.

**Important Note:** While this plugin provides helpful checks, it's crucial to understand that no single method can guarantee complete security. Use these checks as part of a comprehensive security strategy that includes other best practices like code obfuscation, secure data storage, and server-side validation.
