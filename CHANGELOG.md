A Flutter plugin that provides device and platform-related security features.

## Overview

**flutter_protector** helps secure your Flutter apps by detecting emulator usage, root/jailbreak status, VPN connections, proxy settings, and potential sniffing apps.  
This plugin is designed to strengthen your app's security layer through device integrity verification.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** While this plugin adds security checks, no single method can guarantee 100% protection. Always combine it with best practices such as code obfuscation, encrypted storage, and server-side validation.
